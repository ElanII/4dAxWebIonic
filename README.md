# 4dAxWebIonic

scripts for creating a web interface using Ionic and 4D :
1 - use Ionic Creator to create the prototype then download it to your computer
2 - create an API for the 4D database with projects methods (api_anciens ...)
3 - link the static prototype to the API to show dynamic data from 4D
